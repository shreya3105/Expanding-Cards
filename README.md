# Expanding-Cards
The project aims to develop a website page that features expanding cards that display additional information when hovered over. This interactive element will provide users with a dynamic and engaging way to access more details about a particular item or topic.
Additionally, JavaScript functions will be implemented to handle the hover functionality and control the expansion of the cards.
The main focus of the project is to create a series of expanding cards that reveal additional information when hovered over. Users will initiate the expansion of the cards by hovering over them with their cursor. Each card will be associated with a hover button that appears when the user hovers over the card, enabling them to trigger the expansion effect.

JavaScript Functions:
JavaScript functions will be used to control the hover effect and ensure smooth interaction with the cards. These functions will also handle any additional logic or effects associated with the hover buttons or the cards themselves.
